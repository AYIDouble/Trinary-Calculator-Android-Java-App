## Trinary Operations ➕ ➖ ➗ ✖️

- **\+ (Addition)**
- **\- (Subtraction)**
- **\* (Multiplication)**
- **\/ (Division)**

## As efficient as possible ⚙️

The **Calculator** is designed to give responses on every action,
this is noticeable as an example at the addition of two Trytes,
while you're typing, an algorithm already calculates every number you type and displays the result.
